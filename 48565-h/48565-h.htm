<h2><a name="AUTHORS_FOREWORD" id="AUTHORS_FOREWORD"></a>AUTHOR’S FOREWORD</h2>

<p>In <i>Laugh and Live</i>, my sole purpose was
to emphasize our first duty toward ourselves,
which consists of doing our level best at
everything we undertake, and making the best
of every situation that arises to confront us.</p>

<p>All through my early life I read inspirational
books and liked them best of all. They
seemed to beckon me on. I could feel myself
being pulled along by an unseen hand.</p>

<p>Let there be no mistake about <i>Making
Life Worth While</i>. It has no particular
plan or sequence whereby to back up its
title. Nearly everything has to do with such
a subject and that is what the book contains&mdash;everything
in general&mdash;and nothing in
particular&mdash;just such things as came to mind
that seemed worth while.</p>

<p>As a follow up to <i>Laugh and Live</i> here’s
hoping that it will <i>fill the bill</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">LITTLE GRAINS OF SAND</span></h2>

<p>Holding down a seat in the <i>rocking chair
fleet</i> out on the shady piazza is most certainly
not making the most out of life.</p>

<p>We all remember the line&mdash;“If wishes
were fishes we’d have some fried.” That is
the answer to those who rock and dream, and
hope for something to <i>turn up</i> instead of
<i>turning up</i> something on their own account.</p>

<p>Of course, there is a time for everything,
even the stealthy, creeping rocking chair&mdash;and
that’s about bedtime. In the estimation
of an eminent neurologist there is no crime
against nature in the home that cannot be
traced to this monstrous thief of time, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
while apparently screeching and groaning
under its load, is, in reality, shouting with
joy at the job it is putting up on its occupant.</p>

<p><i>Taking the most out of life</i> is the proper
label for this old squeaker&mdash;breeder of idle
contentment, day-dreams, inertia. Like
everything else that saps the energy from
mind and body, it counts its victims by the
score, and throws them up on the sands of
time.</p>

<div id="ip_14" class="figcenter" style="width: 564px;"><img src="images/p014.jpg" width="564" height="396" alt="" /><div class="caption">&mdash;&mdash;and his brother John</div></div>

<p>Speaking of sand may serve to remind the
reader of a well-known poem handed down
from Grandmother days, which holds a lot
of precious wisdom&mdash;probably more than
any poem of its length&mdash;its breadth and
depth being equal to the world in which we
live. In childhood days this poem took my
fancy, being short, to the point, and easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
remember. I was ready to recite it immediately
and <i>automatically</i> upon request. I had
no thought then as to its meaning, but as the
years rolled by it tagged along in memory
until now I find in it a sort of statement of
fact upon which to build my theory of making
life worth while. Here it is:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Little drops of water,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Little grains of sand,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Maketh the mighty ocean</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And a pleasant land.</i></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>To those who adopt the idea of finding
out just <i>why</i> little drops of water and little
grains of sand accomplish so much, will come
the greatest reward in the way of mental
satisfaction&mdash;and, meanwhile, they’ll keep
busy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
There is unbounded happiness in the pursuit
of knowledge; a wonderful satisfaction
in building up one’s treasure house of information.
It’s all so easy, requiring nothing
more than a healthy, enquiring mind&mdash;and
<i>a zest for the sport</i>.</p>

<p>Zest is a big word. It has to do with <i>get
up and git</i>, which has been most appropriately
boiled down into the word <i>pep</i>. Lazy
people, mentally or bodily, seldom get anywhere.
What they do get is either accidental
or by <i>absorption</i>&mdash;if by the latter process,
more likely through the pores than the brain.
No use to talk to them about making life
worth while.</p>

<div id="ip_16" class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;"><img src="images/p016.jpg" width="401" height="566" alt="" /><div class="caption">Teaching his dog to smile</div></div>

<p>The greatest of human possessions are a
well-trained <i>mind</i>, a <i>body</i> to match, and a
love of achievement, without which a man is
old before his time. After that comes <i>energy</i>&mdash;the
great propeller! What the brain directs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the body will carry out&mdash;if the <i>propeller</i>
is working. No hesitation&mdash;when the
<i>will</i> commands the <i>body</i> acts. They synchronize&mdash;they
are attuned, harmonious, fraternal,
so to speak. And to hitch them together
is just as easy as getting wet by
standing bareheaded in the rain.</p>

<p>There is no intention of littering up this
chapter with ways and means of putting
one’s upper story in fine working order&mdash;or
the physical structure below. That is first-reader
information. If we treat ourselves
right, the brain will behave and the body will
follow suit. <i>Activity</i>, mental and physical,
is <i>the meat in the cocoanut</i>. Seeking knowledge
leads along the sunlit paths of life
where happiness abounds. The alternative
is <i>mental shiftlessness</i>, leading from nowhere
to nothing at all.</p>

<p>Cain killed Abel because, undoubtedly, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the shiftless life he led. Indolence and ignorance
being the order of his day, he lacked
the stamina with which to control his mind.
His physical forces merely acted in consonance
with his rage at Abel’s popularity.
Cupidity led him on, but if Cain hadn’t lost
his head through lack of <i>will to control himself</i>
the example of murder might never have
been set before mankind.</p>

<p>Centuries have come and gone and still
the passion to kill continues upon the face
of the earth. To stop it is but a matter of
correcting human thought through physical
and mental training so that those notions
which interfere with a normal, healthy brain
tendency, will cease to exist. This done, the
degenerate born of indolence somewhere
along the line, will disappear from the face
of the earth in jig time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
New intellectual forces will do the trick;
forces built up from healthy, right thinking,
energetic investigation, and consequent acquisition
of knowledge.</p>

<p>How the world will wag a few years hence
depends upon Mothers and Fathers of today.
As great trials are <i>strengthening to
character</i>, the prospect seems bright.</p>

<span class="subhead">AS THE TWIG IS BENT</span></h2>

<p>Temperament looms large in the game of
life, and, like all other human brain tendencies,
is subject to regulation through the exercise
of ordinary horse sense. We often
hear one person speak of another’s temperamental
qualities in the light of an <i>incurable
disease</i>, and more than likely in an apologetic
way. A faulty tendency is usually laid at
the door of a doughty grandsire on one or
both sides of the house and left there as a
piece of ordinary table gossip to be resumed
any old time without notice.</p>

<p>We’ve all heard someone dispose of another
with quick dispatch by the casual remark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
“<i>He’s temperamental</i>.” It all depends
upon the inflection of the speaker’s voice
whether his words are intended as a knockout
blow or an apology in behalf of the culprit.
But any time you want to pursue the subject
you’ll hear about some obdurate old ancestor
who passed the buck on to his posterity.</p>

<p>While we most assuredly do inherit various
<i>mental attitudes</i> from our ancestors,
there’s nothing we cannot get rid of if we
resolve to do so. There is nothing fatal
about preconceived notions handed down to
us. Mental culture through education and
association is the royal road. If, through ignorance,
or narrow-mindedness, one should
prefer to hang on to certain personal or mental
crudities just for the sake of posing as a
“chip off of the old block,” then let the punishment
fit the crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Temperament plays a big part in <i>making
life worth while</i> and is more largely due to
the time in which we live and with whom we
associate than to inheritance. It is the physical
department that is really handed down
to us&mdash;the <i>blood in our veins</i> rather than the
dents on our brains. To be subject to scrofula
from infancy is no fault of our own, but
to continue an eccentricity under the claim of
<i>inherited temperament</i> is excusable only
upon the score of ignorance.</p>

<p>People do inherit brain tendencies, but
they are all subject to control through the
will to <i>do or don’t</i>, as the case may be. Supposing
grandfather used to swear like a
trooper&mdash;and he probably did&mdash;the habit was
temperamental to the extent of being in tune
with the times in which he lived. But what
grandson of to-day would think of claiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
exemption by reason of inherited temperament
if addicted to the same vulgar habit?
On the other hand, if we are born with <i>rheumatic</i>
tendencies we may expect to fight
with them all our lives. One is a brain tendency,
<i>subject to control</i>; the other is a
blood-inheritance that <i>we may never correct</i>.</p>

<p>Personal habits of thought or action are
temperamental according to the avidity with
which we cling to them. George Ade has
said that a man might be born with a hair lip
or a club foot, but <i>whiskers</i> were his own
fault. Thus we were handed the best possible
line of demarcation between the <i>inherited
tendency</i> and the <i>personal temperament</i>.
So, if we were of the temperament to wear a
beard because our great grandfather wore
one we could, if the notion struck us, take it
to the barber and have it cut away. Just so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
we may get out from any other <i>temperamental
habit</i>, or thought, or action, through
the very simple process of becoming masters
of our own minds. Grandfather may
hand us a line of tainted blood that we can’t
manage, but temperament is our own to
manage as we will.</p>

<p>Control over one’s temperament is positively
necessary in making life worth while.
If we are bent on securing full happiness for
having lived, we are bound to contribute our
share toward an ultimate <i>world sanity</i> in
which the word temperament may not serve
to cloak <i>mental deficiency</i>. College life
takes the kink out of the untrained mind and
makes it behave normally. It makes no allowance
for the accentuated temperament.
Fool notions brought along from the dear
old home town are soon sifted into the chaff
barrel and <i>common sense</i> comes into its own.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE NEW ORDER OF LIVING</span></h2>

<p>We’re never old until we think we are&mdash;this
I say, not as a <i>sop</i> to those beyond the
half-way station, but as a conclusion after
some years of observation and association
with men.</p>

<p>I know some <i>young men of sixty</i> who are
putting over a sample of golf that annexes
my goat. One forgets their age when he
finds them up and coming on every proposition
of legitimate sport and pleasure.
They’ve <i>learned how to live</i> and <i>are</i> living.</p>

<p>There is a big change in the habits of men.
The day in which we live is replete with simple
enjoyments and facilities whereby to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
make the most of them. <i>Achievement</i> keeps
them young, and achievement is a matter of
management rather than working hours.
<i>Organization</i> cuts the hours off of the business
day which leaves ample time for the recreation
needed to insure a good appetite, a
healthy body, and the right kind of sleep.
If there is any secret in this simple process
then consider that the cat is “out of the bag.”
<i>It’s yours.</i></p>

<div id="ip_32" class="figcenter" style="width: 555px;"><img src="images/p032.jpg" width="555" height="392" alt="" /><div class="caption">“And her name was Maud”</div></div>

<p>If we see a lean, hungry, decrepit mule
wearily dragging his load along we know at
a glance that he is underfed, overworked, and
<i>doesn’t receive proper care</i>. He works too
many hours a day, stands abuse from his
driver, becomes morose, just the same as a
human being, and finally, indifferent to what
happens. Thus reduced to the depth of despair,
he actually awaits the crack of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
whip across his loins before answering the
call to move along.</p>

<p>But times are changing for both men and
mules. Neither will stand the abuse and
neglect of years gone by. Men are no longer
the slaves of the <i>big boss</i>. They have certain
hours for work, after which their time is their
own.</p>

<p>Fortunately the era of treating one’s self
decently is on. The barroom has ceased to
be the national indoor sport. Every self-respecting
town or city has joined in the
<i>community of interests</i> theory that out-of-door
life is good for its citizens. The result
is <i>play-grounds</i> for children, <i>public parks</i> for
all of the family, and <i>golf courses</i> nearby for
the men. It beats the old front porch rocking
chair proposition forty ways.</p>

<p>It isn’t more than twenty-five years since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the real out-of-door era began to dawn. I
remember distinctly as a boy of ten how hard
it was to raise a companion after the evening
meal. My parents held liberal views on the
subject. They trusted me in the matter of
keeping out of mischief and about the only
warning I received was, “Don’t go far, and
<i>don’t stay out too late</i>.” With such elastic
instructions I had very little trouble in keeping
the record straight, for my parents never
held me to strict account.</p>

<p>In my meanderings, however, I found the
boys of my acquaintance pretty well
hemmed in during the evening hours. The
scene is easily recalled. The front stoop is
plastered with rugs; the mother, father, sisters,
aunts, and grandmother are seated
about on the steps, hammock or porch chairs.
Bob, Bill, Dick or Jim, as the case might be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
was first to be noticed leaning against the
front gate, or looking dreamily over the side
fence. But as soon as the porch arguments
began to warm up he could be seen edging
along slowly, inch by inch, toward the rear&mdash;just
nonchalantly, two pickets at a time,
without any special semblance of hurrying.
If his mother <i>had the floor</i> in the argument
he got away speedily and he generally waited
for that.</p>

<p>But success was not always the case.
Many times have I stood impatiently out of
view giving the <i>hurry-up</i> signal, when suddenly
there came a loud call from the front
that caused Robert to fall back into his own
yard and walk quickly around to the whenceness
of the clamor.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Ma?” he would enquire&mdash;as
if he didn’t thoroughly well know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
“I want you to stay around here where I
can keep an eye on you. <i>Then I’ll know
where you are.</i>”</p>

<p>Sometimes this kind of a backset would
require nearly a half hour of skilful jockeying
to repair. After that only the boldest
of plans stood a chance to succeed, such as
walking into the house from the front as if
in deep disgust, or after a drink of water in
the rear of the house. Then out through the
kitchen door and over the back fence in a
jiffy.</p>

<div id="ip_36" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><img src="images/p036.jpg" width="400" height="570" alt="" /><div class="caption">A pointed argument</div></div>

<p>A nudge from <i>sister</i> often nullified this
subterfuge when the mother seemed about to
fall for the project, and that meant the loss
of another fifteen minutes during which
Bobby would actually go and take a swallow
of water and come back to the porch, there
to stretch and yawn until told that he’d better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
go in and go to bed. <i>Victory at last</i> for
Bob, showing that there was more than one
way to win a battle even in those days. The
slamming of an upstairs bed-room door,
meant for his mother’s ears, a slide down the
“rain pipe”&mdash;and over the fence for Bobby.</p>

<p>But what a wonderful change has come
into the parental mind since then. Now all
Bob does is to announce where he is going&mdash;to
the “gym,” over to Bill’s, motor-boating,
canoeing, bicycling, a hike in the park, or a
look in on the movies. Home and to bed by
ten o’clock.</p>

<p>And what is the result? Boys of twelve
now days become officers in Boy Scout companies.
They go in for everything likely to
make them <i>athletic, manly and alert</i>. At sixteen
they have more general knowledge than
boys of twenty had twenty-five years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
And their minds are cleaner, likewise their
bodies. Schooling comes easier to them, although
the courses are far more advanced.
It takes knowledge to get started off right
now days.</p>

<p>This is an age of <i>pep</i>, and the competition
of today means <i>pep vs. pep</i>. With equal
mental preparedness the man with the brawn
will stand the gaff that would kill his soft
competitor. <i>Lest we forget</i>&mdash;recreation, a
good appetite, a healthy body, and the
proper amount of sleep&mdash;are positive requirements
in <i>making life worth while</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">FEEDING THE INTELLECT</span></h2>

<p>Feeding the intellect is naturally the most
fascinating pursuit in this life and probably
will be in the life to come. There is nothing
like stocking up the mind, tickling the brain
cells, making dents in the cerebellum, for
thereby is induced the most <i>perfect sanity</i>
and the power to think with precision.</p>

<p>It is bully to be able to think straight to
the point, and to quickly analyze right down
to the bone. Such ability loans us proper
respect for ourselves and compels the respect
of all with whom we may brush against.</p>

<p>Power to think begins with <i>first realizations</i>,
and thereafter we have only to add fuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
to the intellectual fires day by day, month by
month, and year by year, until we arrive at
that state of mental sufficiency which may
happily be termed “the fullness thereof.”</p>

<p>Not until we cross this bridge are we safe&mdash;not
until then will we have come into a
state of <i>sane thinking</i>&mdash;nor will we be <i>fully
alive</i>! On our march we will have learned
to delve with patience, listen with understanding,
and communicate with intelligence.
Then we may give and take with common
understanding with the best of them. What
we get we store away for use when needed.
Then may we commune with our intellectual
equals on the basis of <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash;<i>horse
and horse</i>&mdash;“<i>even Stephen</i>.”</p>

<p>But what a heartache when we cannot
give! What a sensation of regret when we
find ourselves standing still intellectually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
while we watch the procession go by. Not
capable of giving, likewise we are handicapped
in our ability to receive&mdash;<i>we’re
hitched to a post</i>, so to speak, along with
other species of lesser understanding.</p>

<p>Alongside of us in our journey through
life are sure to be men of more than ordinary
achievement, who by dint of <i>special genius</i>
have accomplished worthy objects most passing
well&mdash;something that brought them
wealth or fame and likely both&mdash;but left
them dumb and speechless in the presence
of intellectual persons, who, in self-defense,
must pass them up for want of <i>mental fellowship</i>.</p>

<p>To speak of the “<i>Dark Ages</i>” is but a
polite reference to that period of time when
mankind generally was known to be “addle-pated.”
The light refused to shine upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
<i>thimbleful of brains</i>, although the sun of centuries
had blazed down upon a world of half-baked
intellects&mdash;and even yet has work
ahead. But coming through the ages, in the
due course of events, a few master minds
coincided in the belief that a little exercise
was good for the “noddle” and set about it
to experiment.</p>

<p>The first hard work indulged in by our
early ancestry, after receiving a slight smattering
of instruction, was to <i>kill off their
teachers</i>. Many centuries were allowed to
skip by before education was again utilized
in stimulating the understanding.</p>

<div id="ip_44" class="figcenter" style="width: 572px;"><img src="images/p044.jpg" width="572" height="404" alt="" /><div class="caption">“Smile when you say it”</div></div>

<p>Pending the dawn of the new era, man
was taught only the use of his hands and feet
for the sake of his stomach&mdash;his upper story
becoming a warehouse for dark superstitions,
and fearful forebodings. It is not unlikely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
that from this period descended the
later day reference to certain persons as
<i>numskulls</i>&mdash;a species of mankind known to
have <i>bats in the belfry</i>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the seeming uselessness
of many hundreds of centuries in their relation
to human intelligence, there is no discounting
the fact that we have finally come
into an age when brain power is not counted
a misdemeanor and made subject to fine and
imprisonment. From the end of our Civil
War to the breaking out of the great world-wide
strife, the intellect of man had expanded
tremendously. More important still,
intellect had been discovered to be a <i>world-asset</i>,
and of such mighty consequence that
<i>human knowledge</i> progressed amazingly.</p>

<p>Pity it is that the world’s brain power
could not have forestalled the great slaughter&mdash;impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
however, at this stage of our
mental development. But the time is coming&mdash;our
grandchildren will see the day&mdash;when
<i>intellectuality</i> will rule the universe.
Brains and bodies of individuals are to be developed
for other <i>uses than war</i>. Until that
day arrives we are bound to continue as before,
and will, with true patriotism, <i>follow
the flag of our cause</i>.</p>

<p>Some day when our intellects have been
fed up into a higher state of efficiency and
humanity is more nearly matched in brain
power, settlements between nations will be
made beside the lamp of reason rather than
under the flare of the cannon’s mouth.</p>

<span class="subhead">BACKING UP THE FLAG</span></h2>

<p>Loyalty is one of those three-syllable
words with a big meaning all its own. Out
of the letters composing it can be spelled two
other words&mdash;the preposition <i>to</i>; and the adverb
<i>all</i>. <i>Loyalty to all</i>&mdash;everything worth
while; our country, our homes, our government,
and the friends we have “and their
adoption tried.” It seems a shame to hear
this fine word used in any other connection,
such as “loyal to the gang”&mdash;“loyal to his
confederates”&mdash;“loyal to the enemy.” It is
too fine a word to be employed in a manner
possessing the significance of the word
“traitor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Now that the word <i>loyalty</i> has come back
into such vast everyday usage, the time is
ripe to nail it down hard and fast to the principles
for which it stands. Why not say “he
was in cahoots with the gang”&mdash;“false to his
constituency”&mdash;“dishonest with his confederates?”
Then, in our mind’s eye, let us hang
the word <i>loyalty</i> alongside of the <i>flag</i> and
keep it there for all time.</p>

<p>As I write this chapter, keeping in mind
the subject of <i>Making Life Worth While</i>,
a feeling of serenity pervades my inner consciousness.
I believe that loyalty practically
reigns supreme in America. I believe that
the fifty-fifty variety has become scarcer
than hen’s teeth when measured by the whole
citizenship. Only among the unenlightened,
the profligates, the misanthropes and <i>enemy
aliens</i>, are they bound to be found at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Thanks to governmental efficiency during
times most trying, the searchlight has been
turned upon the meaning of the word loyalty
in this country. The flag symbolizes it and
it hangs everywhere. We take off our hats
to it when we pass it on the street, and when
we hear the songs that match it we join our
voices with the rest.</p>

<p>To love the flag is a <i>soul</i> quality and when
the souls of a hundred million strong go out
in support of the <i>Stars and Stripes</i> there is
mighty little standing room for <i>the mere onlooker</i>.</p>

<p><i>He is either with us or against us</i>&mdash;that’s
the slogan that thins the ranks of the unbelievers
in our country. It makes them sit up
and stare at the truth. It makes them blink
their eyes in wonder, which is first aid in
thinking things over. It causes them to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
around and compare their standpoint with
that represented by the <i>Star Spangled Banner.</i></p>

<p>In taking stock of the situation here is
what they found to be true&mdash;that this great
country stands for peace&mdash;not only for itself,
but its neighbors all over the world.
That peace is so desirable, and so essential
that it is worth fighting for to the <i>last man</i>
and the <i>last dollar</i>. That without peace
nothing counts as of value in the entire inventory
of things worth while and, therefore,
nothing remains but to fight&mdash;<i>and to a finish</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_52" class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;"><img src="images/p052.jpg" width="402" height="568" alt="" /><div class="caption">Companions</div></div>

<p>When your Uncle Sam rolls up his sleeves
preparatory to a scrap he begins to take on
size that distinguishes him from the ordinary
fighter. He goes about it methodically, and
allows himself the proper time in which to
get in readiness. Then he takes a running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
jump into the middle of the ring. After
this the disinterested onlooker isn’t long in
catching the fact that, as a mere matter of
discretion, it is far better to be <i>with</i> Uncle
Sam than to be <i>against</i> him. Also it must
creep into his mind that if he doesn’t want to
be <i>smashed</i> into a proper state of mind, the
best thing to do is to <i>join in and help</i>.</p>

<p>If a hundred million people want peace
bad enough to fight for it, both for themselves
and their neighbors, it isn’t for <i>slackers</i>
either in thought or in spirit to stand on the
side lines and watch the scrap. People of
that mould do not belong in America.</p>

<p>Everybody must do his part and do it
right. There are thousands of ways of helping
on toward victory. There is more than
one way of fighting. The most potent of
all is to <i>back up the man who does</i>&mdash;except,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
of course, when his time comes, every man
capable of pulling a trigger must pick up his
pack and take his place <i>on the firing line</i>.
Meanwhile it behooves <i>all of us</i> to be ready
for the call.</p>

<span class="subhead">HALF-BAKED KNOWLEDGE</span></h2>

<p>It will take more than a <i>star shell</i> to light
up the pathway of a man who clutters his
brain with half-baked knowledge. Pitfalls
galore are ahead of him no matter which way
he may turn. Such people are, by nature, of
the cocksure variety, going in where angels
fear to tread, and gaining nothing for certain
by reason of their experiences. In time
they earn the reputation of being <i>bull-headed</i>
and sooner or later are on their way
downstream without a rudder.</p>

<p>Sometimes the strong-willed fellow of
fragmentary knowledge isn’t to blame for
his affliction. Every little circumstance has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
something to do with his future course and
if he happens to be born “on the wrong side
of the moon,” his course is more or less <i>predestined</i>.
He views things through a film&mdash;hazy-like,
and inaccurate. To him investigation
means nothing. His mind is like a sieve
that will not retain the fine particles which
must accumulate until a firm foundation
forms upon which to bear <i>a permanent
housing for his reasoning powers</i>.</p>

<p>The worst phase of the ever-ready reckoner
of uncertain statistics is that he usually
circulates among the credulous. Who of us
is there that hasn’t at some time in our variegated
careers sat across from him at an old-fashioned
boarding house <i>table d’hote</i>?
Even now we can hear him saying, “<i>My notion
of that is this!</i>” And wasn’t it fun to
watch those who drank it all in and gulped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
it down with their coffee? The green cheese
story about the moon would have been swallowed
by some of them if our <i>half-baked
know-it-all</i> persisted in its truth.</p>

<p>For such as him, no doubt, was composed
Kipling’s wonderfully cynical line, “alas, we
know he never could know and never could
understand.” And also for such as him it
was ordained that he should never stay in one
place long. Something tells him to keep
moving&mdash;perhaps the giggling that breaks
out in the midst of a lofty peroration; a snort
of derision at some observation intended to
be philosophical but which fell far short of
the mark.</p>

<p>While it doesn’t take long to pack up and
locate elsewhere, it must be tedious work to
have continually the task on hand of making
new friends&mdash;<i>only to lose them</i>. But that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
is the penalty of becoming the butt of the
jokester, who will not be denied. Once he
finds a victim it’s time for that victim to
move. The jokester has no pity, and in
lofty speech he tells his victim so&mdash;accompanied
by shouts of approval from those who
hear and understand.</p>

<div id="ip_60" class="figcenter" style="width: 562px;"><img src="images/p060.jpg" width="562" height="402" alt="" /><div class="caption">“What ho!” says the King. “Ho hum!” replied his guest.</div></div>

<p>The ego of ignorance which stands by its
false assumptions from sheer lack of correct
understanding invites pity that it seldom receives.
In due course of human events the
distributor of half-baked wisdom will be
grafted with a twig from the tree of learning
and thus the species will become extinct.
This, as Shakespeare says, “is devoutly to be
wished,” and while wishing it seems perfectly
all right to express the hope that those who
read this short chapter will make a point of
sowing a few seeds in certain gardens where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
tall weeds now grow, “just for the lack of
the rake and the hoe.” A little sarcasm will
turn the trick.</p>

<span class="subhead">HARNESSING THE BRAIN</span></h2>

<p>To make life truly worth while one would,
if possible, follow his natural bent, having
trained himself accordingly, otherwise no
matter how successful he might become in
<i>a material sense</i>, regrets would be inevitable
and likely to lead to a <i>surly old age</i>. It is a
vast mistake to believe that the possession of
great wealth insures happiness&mdash;and <i>without
happiness</i> whose life is worth while?</p>

<p>The makings of many a good butcher,
baker, or candlestick-maker have gone to
waste when a youngster walked through the
<i>wrong doorway</i> in search of his <i>first job</i>.
That is the initial lottery ticket we buy&mdash;and
sometimes pay for most dearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
The situation is better now than heretofore,
particularly if the youngster has, on
starting out, the advantage of at least a high
school education. To that extent he has a
<i>trained mind</i>. If he could have gone on
through <i>college or technical school</i> his success
would be practically assured. To get
through would mean that he had acquired
proper <i>mental balance</i>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the great majority still go
forth into the world of affairs with small educational
equipment, just when their minds
are least prepared, which accounts for the
old saying&mdash;“<i>a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing</i>.”</p>

<p>So, when John Henry Jones, the hat-maker’s
son, shows a disinclination to go to school
his father is pretty sure to take a shot at
him something like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
“Either go to school, or go to work. <i>You
can’t lay around and loaf.</i>”</p>

<p>Now there was where John’s father got
off on the wrong foot. There and then he
missed his chance for a real heart to heart
talk and at a time when his boy, from pure
lack of reasoning ability, had worked his
mind into a bad state. Then was the time to
have dropped his tools and straightened out
the kinks in the youngster’s noggin. A little
friendly counsel might easily have shown the
folly of going out into the world without
<i>brain tools</i> to work with.</p>

<p>As for the boy, his whole future most
likely hung upon the result of an interview
inside <i>the first doorway he entered</i>. Not
possessing a proper amount of mental training
his natural tendency became his sole
guardian at the supreme moment of his career&mdash;<i>the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
start</i>. Surely it would be a matter
of luck how he came through. His future,
in a sense, was in the hands of strangers
and a strange environment.</p>

<p>In these days people are employed to fill
a certain niche. If they fill it, they are allowed
to <i>keep on filling it</i>. There’s little
chance to look up from the job&mdash;and when
the day’s work ends there’s little chance to
look around for another. Thus if John
Henry was set to work in a menial position
at the beginning he might never be regarded
as eligible for a position leading toward real
advancement. He came without knowledge
and for lack of opportunity he gained none.
Being a perfectly good <i>sweeper</i> and <i>duster</i>
he remained to sweep and dust until, in
despair, he tries for a job at another place.</p>

<p>“But,” you say, “the example is not trustworthy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Look at the great men who started
out in a small way. They are now the bulwark
of the nation.”</p>

<p>Perhaps true, but times have changed radically.
It is the <i>boy graduate</i> that is being
sought after now. “Big Business” is bidding
for the annual graduating classes long
in advance. It wants <i>trained minds</i> to fill
<i>brain positions</i>&mdash;and that’s why the college
man and the graduates of technical schools
forge ahead so quickly. They literally run
over the half-educated, untrained workers
who sit and wonder at their own lack of advancement.</p>

<p>It’s not a matter to pout about. There’s
only one thing to do&mdash;<i>work out of it</i>. A special
course in the thing the mind and talent
is best fitted for is the way out. Why wait
for “lightning” to strike us? Night schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
abound in all branches of learning. Many
a man has turned himself into a brilliant lawyer,
expert accountant, or famous editor,
through <i>night school work</i>. Diligence and
perseverance is the price of success, and only
through success do we find life entirely worth
while.</p>

<p>I have received many letters from boys
and young men who had read <i>Laugh and
Live</i>, asking me to name the requisites for
success. I have made but one answer to all
such inquiries:&mdash;<i>A healthy, clean body and
a trained, clean mind.</i> There is no other answer.</p>

<span class="subhead">EXALTING THE EGO</span></h2>

<p>Some day I propose to write a novel!</p>

<p>The main reason for this determination is
the fact that I have never written one. I
don’t know that it will become a “best goer”&mdash;and
the chances are against it&mdash;but I’ll do
my best just the same. <i>And I hope to win.</i></p>

<p>My reason for writing a fictional story is
that by so doing I will exercise my imaginative
faculties and thus <i>prolong their usefulness</i>.
The power to imagine is an asset that
must not be dulled by neglect. It responds
to exercise just as readily as do the arms and
legs.</p>

<p>Mental gymnastics are helpful, in fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
they are absolutely necessary in keeping
alert the upper story of the general structure.
They make of the brain a <i>spectacular
trapeze performer</i> toward which all eyes upturn
when it takes its place upon the swinging
bar.</p>

<p>The ability to write a successful novel
would be a crowning achievement since it
draws upon experience and vision in order
to assemble interesting characters around
an agreeable plot. Love, of course, must
furnish the motif because love is the highest
and most noble form of passion&mdash;and <i>passion
rules the universe</i>.</p>

<p>When we contemplate the writing of a
novel we indulge in aspiration of the highest
order. The fact that not one novel in a thousand
is likely to measure up to a masterpiece
should not halt one’s determination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
put over a winner if possible. But novel
writing is <i>big game hunting</i>, requiring ammunition
of considerable power&mdash;and the
<i>aim must be perfect</i>.</p>

<p>One should try for small game first, being
careful to make a bonfire out of every effort
that will not stand the test of several months
in cold storage. Real fiction can wait. It
needn’t be served to order. Any novel that
is going to live through one generation of
applauding readers will keep a few months
while its author uses the pruning hook. His
judgment will be all the keener each time he
goes over it.</p>

<p>When I write my novel I shall allow no
close friend to read it in advance of its legitimate
publication, after having been duly
passed upon by a calm and candid professional
critic <i>with a beady eye</i>. When one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
these zest-worn individuals wades through
my effort from first to last page and comes
up smiling it will be time enough to indulge
in a faint hope. It is always best for success
to <i>ooze in</i> rather than to come as a deluge.
It gives us time to consider ways and means
of taking care of the output. Also it serves
to ward off an aggravated case of disappointment
if it doesn’t turn out to be a <i>genuine
gusher</i>. We never know the real verdict
until we hear from the multitude. No multitude,
no verdict necessary&mdash;<i>the book is dead</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_76" class="figcenter" style="width: 566px;"><img src="images/p076.jpg" width="566" height="400" alt="" /><div class="caption">Where once one equals two</div></div>

<p>It isn’t for the reason that I lack for things
to do that I propose to try to write a successful
novel, nor is my reason mercenary.
There is no secret about the matter either.
Some years ago I determined <i>not</i> to go
through life with a <i>single track mind</i>. To
obviate this calamity it dawned upon me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
I must take an interest in every little and big
thing that came my way. Once the resolution
took the form of habit, it became a great
pleasure to persist in the pursuit of information,
but the main benefit derived has
been the development of a determination to
<i>do things myself</i>.</p>

<p>Determination stands in constant need of
repair else it deteriorates into mere obsession
and falls of its own weight. <i>The habit of
investigation</i> builds up self-confidence, without
which, determination has no prop with
which to sustain itself.</p>

<p>Investigation is a two-sided activity of the
mental processes&mdash;it comes in loaded and can
go out loaded if there’s anything inside to
facilitate the movement. To prove this
theory is my reason for taking a fling at
novel writing, and by succeeding my case is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
made. At least it will have been proved that
one’s mind is a reconverter&mdash;that what it
imbibes in one form it may exude in another.
Also it proves that if one does not exalt his
own ego no one else can do it for him.</p>

<span class="subhead">GENIUS PLUS INITIATIVE</span></h2>

<p>Genius is twenty per cent idea, thirty per
cent talent, and fifty per cent <i>initiative</i>.
Ideas are small in themselves when reduced
to <i>brass tacks</i>, but when we put the steam behind
they often turn into something tremendous.</p>

<p>Even a fool may have an idea, but it takes
<i>brains and pep</i> to put one over.</p>

<p>Most every one has had a notion worth
while, but in most cases they hold it cheap
on the theory that if it really amounted to
anything some <i>genius</i> would have thought
of it long ago and put it into practical use.
There is where <i>initiative</i> was lacking&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
talent as well&mdash;but initiative would
have brought in talent <i>from the outside</i>.</p>

<p>The word genius has been largely misapplied.
Many men who were merely astute
in one way or another have been placarded
with the label of genius. But the <i>real genius</i>
is one whose idea has saved something for
his fellow man in <i>time</i>, <i>labor</i>, and <i>money</i>.
Who would have thought forty years ago
that the whispering cups which children
talked into, and by means of which they
could hear each other’s voices a distance of
fifty or a hundred feet, would turn into the
greatest labor-saving device in all the world!
Such has been the fact ever since the telephone
became an everyday utility.</p>

<p>The principle was discovered in a toy&mdash;the
practical, every-day application as a
labor-saving device was to come&mdash;but it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
soon. A genius brought it about by inventing
a transmitter which enlarged the sound
waves when vibrated over electrically
charged wires. Just as simple as water boiling
in a tea kettle&mdash;which, by the way, led
to the <i>steam engine</i>.</p>

<p><i>Steam, steel, and electricity!</i>&mdash;the playground
of the world’s greatest inventors&mdash;<i>where
genius abounds</i>. Here were born our
captains of industry, our fabulous fortunes,
our <i>empire building resources</i>. Intertwined
with these three great principles the <i>super-genius</i>
has romped and played with nature’s
secrets until the age in which we live is one
of <i>touch the button</i>&mdash;and some labor-saving
device does the rest.</p>

<p>We think it wonderful to live in the present
age of genius. Nothing seems lacking.
But what snails we’ll seem to those who come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
along <i>a hundred years from now</i>. Do we
think that Arizona will lack for rain when
she needs it&mdash;even fifty years hence? Surely
the <i>drudgery of the horse</i> will have passed
into oblivion. Mr. Ford to the rescue!
Having taken him out of the roadway, he
most certainly will not allow the horse to go
on slaving in the plough field. That blessing
is already in process of solution.</p>

<p>The real period for the genius is in the
foreground. The hardships of the past are
over. Capital is ready and waiting eagerly
for the new idea no matter how small, <i>or how
big</i>. Genius has but to shake off inertia,
<i>build up initiative</i> and make full use of its
talents. There isn’t a stumbling block in
sight. <i>The road is clear</i>&mdash;and every added
facility helps that much toward making
everybody’s life worth while.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BIG FOUR</span></h2>

<p>I’m for that hard-hitting type of manhood
which stands adamant for the <i>square deal
and no surrender</i> under all circumstances.
It is one thing to wish for justice&mdash;quite another
to stand up and <i>fight for it</i>.</p>

<p>Probably not one man in a thousand is
geared with sufficient heart action to run
counter to <i>a false public opinion</i>. It takes
moral courage to do this, even on a small
scale, whereas to ride a bucking broncho one
needs physical prowess which is quite another
kind of bravery. We’ve all known men who
would fight their weight in wild cats but
would run like a frightened rabbit at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
sight of a pretty woman. To get up and
<i>make a speech</i> would have been out of the
question for them.</p>

<p>I heard of a case where a fine, quiet fellow
who had been elected as a delegate to a small
county convention, was instructed to arise
to his feet at the moment of a certain nomination
and shout “I second the nomination!”
Instead of following instructions <i>he fainted</i>.
This so excited the delegate who was to
“move that the nominations be closed” that
he forgot his part, with the result that an opposition
candidate was quickly proposed,
carried the convention, and, in due course,
<i>was elected</i> by the vote of the people.</p>

<p>Men of the type of President Wilson and
Theodore Roosevelt, each distinctly different
in personality, are about as scarce as hen’s
teeth. There are just two such men in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
hundred and odd millions today. They
stand unique in the courage of their convictions,
and their ability to reach <i>the boundary
lines of public opinion over the world</i>.
Lloyd George belongs in the same corral.</p>

<p>Speaking of President Wilson, one is
amazed at his perspicuity. In procedure
directly opposite from Roosevelt or Lloyd
George, he has no counterpart either in pattern
or turn of mind. Everything yields before
him&mdash;he appears to be <i>indomitable.</i></p>

<p>The need of such a man at this hour is apparent.
He asserts the rights of the nation
as a whole in such a way that the individual
trails in behind him without a quaver of fear
or a compunction of conscience. The President
seems to know the road and results bear
testimony to the fact. In the shortest possible
time he has mobilized the greatest nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
in the world to a war basis of such magnitude
that its martial tread <i>extends around
the world</i>. This being the first globe-girdling
war in all history, who can say that any
other man would have done better&mdash;<i>or even
so well</i>?</p>

<p>Fortunately, this country has another
man who, in the absence of our present
leader, could have stirred the American nation
into action in behalf of its own security.
Hardly need it be said that this man is <i>Theodore
Roosevelt</i>. His distinguished services
in the past would have proclaimed him the
leader in such a vast enterprise <i>had the
emergency existed</i>. Taking things as they
are, his influence has been of tremendous importance
in effecting <i>a united effort</i>. His
willingness to go to the front himself at the
head of a Volunteer Division had its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
weight in determining the whole nation that
<i>the battle was ours</i> as well as for those more
adjacent to the fighting zone. But, to start
with at least, this is a young man’s war, and
the four sons of Roosevelt that went to the
front constitute an ample offering from this
great man at this stage of affairs.</p>

<p>If Lloyd George were a citizen of these
United States, I’d give him a seat beside the
President on the score of <i>bull-dog tenacity</i>.
And I’d give him a look in on Roosevelt for
<i>brain activity</i> and <i>physical courage</i>. And a
seat between both of them for his ability to
<i>scorch the hides of the recalcitrants</i>.</p>

<p>Three big men these&mdash;<i>Wilson</i>, <i>Roosevelt</i>,
<i>Lloyd George</i>. They sit tight for what’s
right. They stand exalted in the estimation
of all right-thinking citizens of the world,
and at this period of their lives are peerless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
in the beneficence of their influence upon
mankind.</p>

<p>And now for the fourth man on my slate&mdash;stand
forth <i>General Joffre</i>! Your initiative
at the first battle of the Marne saved the
world from disaster. You had <i>one chance in
a hundred</i> and&mdash;you saw and you took it.
Your victory saved civilization a colossal setback.
Had your beloved France been forced
to surrender, the dream of the enemy would
have been transformed into fact with Mad
Moloch in the saddle for many a weary year.</p>

<p><i>Here’s to the Big Four</i>&mdash;long may they
live to witness the gratitude of all mankind!</p>

<span class="subhead">APPLYING THE RULE OF REASON</span></h2>

<p>During one of my four-day jumps from
coast to coast recently, I made the acquaintance
of a very affable gentleman in his early
fifties. He had the advantage of me in age,
having passed through my period some
twenty years back, while my advantage lay
before me, yet to be disposed of. He was a
man of brains, his eyes were alert, his years
rested easily upon him. I marveled at his
physical activity, also his <i>mental pep</i>. One
thing he said to me that will hang in my
memory the rest of my days.</p>

<p>“I am guided by my <i>hindsight</i>&mdash;you at
your age, by your <i>foresight</i>,” said he. Then
he went on to explain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
At my age he had ambitions and crowded
on the steam. At <i>forty</i> his success in all
ways seemed assured, so he rushed forward
with all his might. At <i>forty-five</i> he experienced
a period of physical reaction, which,
in the light of his present knowledge, was
a warning, but he did not heed it. At
<i>forty-seven</i> he was a <i>physical</i> and <i>mental
wreck</i>.</p>

<p>“I had failed to adjust myself to my failing
powers,” said he. “I took on greater responsibilities
than ever, bent, as I was, on
rounding out a huge success. I almost
wound up in my grave.”</p>

<p>Now here was a chance for a real pointer
from a man of intellectual force, so I urged
him to go on through the sequence of events
that had brought him back to such superb
health and spirits.</p>

<div id="ip_96" class="figcenter" style="width: 568px;"><img src="images/p096.jpg" width="568" height="400" alt="" /><div class="caption">A rattling good story</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
“It took me three years to get by that ugly
period of mental and physical depression,
the early part of which I spent in floundering
around from one expert to another, traveling
here and there and gaining nothing in the
way of respite, to say nothing of cure. Then
suddenly, I stumbled into an acquaintance
with a new adviser&mdash;<i>a life insurance agent</i>!”</p>

<p>I broke out laughing at this point and he
joined good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d be amused,” said he.
“Every friend I have jokes on the subject.
Nevertheless,” he continued, “this life insurance
agent cured me and I haven’t taken a
spoonful of medicine since I met him. Are
you interested as to details?” he asked, his
eyes twinkling, his cheeks glowing with
health. (Courage, friend reader. This isn’t
the beginning of the novel I intend to write.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
“Up to my ears,” I replied. “I am interested
in every little thing that happens.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s worth your while,” he continued
dryly, “and the ‘cure’ may serve you well
some day. I met this man at Long Beach.
I was sitting under a large umbrella-tent
watching the bathers and feeling like “<i>Sam
Hill</i>,” when a fine, strapping young man
came dripping out of the waves and sauntered
up near me. It was a hot day and
noting my ample shade he came over and
looked down at me good-naturedly. I would
have given all I possessed for his robust
health and grand physique. I motioned to
some unoccupied space under my tent, which
he accepted.</p>

<p>“‘Not sick, I hope?’ said he enquiringly.</p>

<p>“‘Oh-no!’ I blurted back at him. ‘I’m
feeling like a young kitten.’ Then I glowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
at him ferociously. That made him
laugh, and he was a good hand at it. I
turned away from him in disgust, and let him
do his worst. Finally he calmed down and
quite soberly remarked:</p>

<p>“‘<i>You’re not sick</i>&mdash;nothing the matter
with you! I’ll write a policy on you in a
week’s time if you’ll do as I direct. I am a
life insurance agent and I mean what I
say.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll take you up,’ I bellowed in reply,
‘and I’ll bet you five hundred you lose!’ I
was pretty much exasperated at the fellow.</p>

<p>“‘You’re on,’ said he, ‘but I won’t take
your five hundred if I win. Let’s put it this
way&mdash;if you are well enough to pass a rigid
physical examination one week from today
will you let me write you up for a fifty-thousand
dollar policy?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
“‘I will, young man, and you can start
your <i>shell game</i> at your pleasure. But I
won’t stand for any <i>science work or nonsense</i>.
If you bore me I shall tell you so and
that means all bets are off and you go your
way.’</p>

<p>“‘We’ll begin now,’ said he quietly, but
there was a certain air of confidence in his
voice that made me wonder.</p>

<p>“‘First, I’m going to tell you about yourself,’
he went on to say. ‘You’re pretty much
like an engineer who went along forty years
without an accident and then his engine
broke down and both went to the ditch in a
heap. You’ve been successful in business,
anyone would know that at a glance, but
you’ve made a mess of your physical resources.’
I nodded. He was right thus far.</p>

<div id="ip_100" class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;"><img src="images/p100.jpg" width="404" height="568" alt="" /><div class="caption">A one-minute reverie</div></div>

<p>“‘You started in early at the game, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
affairs grew, your responsibilities enlarged,
and you worked your gray matter overtime
without stopping to oil up your machinery.
In other words, you have never played, you
haven’t laughed, you haven’t mingled with
people in a social way. So now you are
pretty near ready for the scrap heap. Am
I right?’</p>

<p>“‘Uhuh&mdash;go on,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘You once came pretty near asking a fine
woman to marry you, but something came
up and you forgot it.’</p>

<p>“‘Yep&mdash;you’re right, Mr. Mind-Reader.
Proceed,’ I said, ‘and whatever you do or
say <i>don’t mind my feelings</i>.’ He noted the
resentment in my voice I presume, for he
waited some time before going on.</p>

<p>“‘The rest is easy&mdash;any life insurance
agent who knows his business could take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the story at this point and go ahead with it.’
He laughed good-naturedly as I shrugged
my shoulders.</p>

<p>“‘You’re an agent, go on with the case.
What’s the answer? Let’s hear all of the
horrible details.’ I was getting peevish, although
the fellow had my interest aroused.</p>

<p>“‘Very well. Yours is the old, old story.
At forty big things loomed ahead&mdash;<i>your
circle enlarged</i>. You gave yourself up to
big plans. They progressed famously and
at <i>forty-five</i> you were a rich and influential
man. But there were a lot of multi-millionaires
that had you skinned on <i>size of pile</i> so
you took the plunge and went after them.
You never gave your waning physical powers
a thought for the next two years, and
then you went all to pieces&mdash;<i>mentally</i>.’</p>

<p>“‘Mentally! what do you mean when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
say <i>mentally</i>? Am I crazy?’ The thought
made me laugh.</p>

<p>“‘Mentally,’ he repeated with a good-natured
smile. ‘You didn’t go crazy&mdash;<i>your
brain fagged</i>. It wore out just like a typewriter
ribbon wears out&mdash;<i>from constant
usage</i>. You’ve been thinking ever since that
your physical department was to blame for
your condition. Nothing of the sort. You
are in fine physical trim, or will be when you
take your mind off of your ailments and forget
about the old deals. Come on, let’s take
a dip,’ he urged, and the first thing I knew
he was dragging me along into the brine.</p>

<p>“To make a long story short, that fellow
<i>got me to laughing</i> and playing like a boy.
We violated every rule of health that had
been laid down by doctors and in five days
were playing golf together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
“So he won his bet after all,” said I enthusiastically,
for I had been pulling for the
agent all through the recital.</p>

<p>“You bet he did, and I let him write me up
for <i>a half million</i> instead of the sum he
named.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” I replied. “And I’m

<p>“That’s right&mdash;at <i>forty</i> begin to adjust
yourself to the next period&mdash;<i>forty-five</i>. Arriving
there safely, begin to adjust for <i>fifty</i>.
If you are alive then you should go on for

simple rules governing health and longevity.
The candle won’t burn at both ends and
stand up in the bargain. At forty I’m going
to begin to adjust&mdash;<i>I believe what the

<span class="subhead">THROUGH DIFFICULTIES TO THE STARS</span></h2>

<p>A college man not only wants his <i>sheepskin</i>
when the great day comes, but his <i>letters</i>
as well. To win his degree he must contribute
to the <i>sum of human knowledge</i>&mdash;a
man-sized job&mdash;considering the large storehouse
already filled to overflowing. But the
wreath somehow rests easier upon the brow
of learning when Ph.D. or Ph.B. are safely
tucked away among the laurel leaves.</p>

<p>Only the trained mind that delves its way
successfully through college or university is
likely to add to existing facts. The vast
majority only succeed in developing a severe
headache. Their intentions were good,
<span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
It isn’t so much the doing of the thing as
the <i>satisfaction of having done it</i>.</p>

<p>My college career was cut short before my
aspiration to excel took root. If I missed
anything it didn’t occur to me then, but looking
backward it has been only natural to
regret that I didn’t stick it out and try for
the honors.</p>

<p>But there are many other ways of making
life worth while. <i>Versatility</i> wins more
“heats” these days than <i>originality</i>. Ideas
are worth little to the man who can’t put
them over and are usually to be bought at
bargain prices. <i>Versatility</i> and <i>personality</i>
hitched tandem are certified winners
before they start as against mere originality.</p>

<p>It is not given to all men to make a success
in college. But there’s one thing certain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
whatever the gain coming out of an attempt
<i>is that much to the good</i>.</p>

<p>College life in itself, with all its joys and
stunts, is a fierce competitor of the curriculum.
Those who would win a degree must
necessarily <i>bone for it</i>, never for an instant
straying from the narrow path leading to the
goal. Likewise it behooves them to keep
both eyes glued upon a lucky star&mdash;<i>for every
little helps</i>.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the “milky way” of admonition
he is almost sure to come upon that famous
old signboard, which reads like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>’Tis naught for sun to shine! Contribute
thy share to the oceans of human knowledge&mdash;you
can if you will.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>I must confess that this bit of poetic advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
made a deep impression upon me. It seemed
to urge me on but not to the same extent that
other matters <i>urged me off</i>. It is a good little
verse just the same and worthy of a hook
in anyone’s memory. Aspiration, perseverance,
never-give-up-the-ship-stick-to-itiveness
is the way the prescription reads for
those who would plant so much as a mustard
seed of original information in the garden
of wisdom.</p>

<span class="subhead">IN ANSWER TO MANY FRIENDS</span></h2>

<p>As I have stated in my foreword, this book
is not intended to adhere to any fixed plan.
I am writing on subjects covering a wide
latitude, many of which have been suggested
by questions out of letters written to
me by friendly spirits who like my picture
plays. Although the facts relating to my
theatrical career have been published over
and over again, hardly a day goes by without
receipt of letters on that subject.</p>

<p>The prevailing notion is that I come from
a theatrical family and that I was educated
for the stage. Nothing is further from the
truth. My father was a lawyer with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
a knowledge of the drama such as few professionals
have had. From the time I was
able to eat I was fed on Shakespeare. When
I was twelve years old I could recite the principal
speeches in most of that gentleman’s
plays.</p>

<p>My article in <i>Photoplay</i> some months ago
gave the whole story in fewest words and
the same is herewith appended.</p>

<p class="p2">My dramatic education was augmented by
frequent contact with great actors. My
father was a friend of Mansfield, Edwin
Booth, Stuart Robson, John Drew, Frederick
Warde and other famous actors who were
his guests whenever they visited Denver.</p>

<p>I once asked Mr. Mansfield about the best
way to prepare for the stage and he told me
that there was no such thing as preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
for the stage; but that there were certain accomplishments
that were essential to <i>great
success</i>. These included a knowledge of
fencing, painting and the French language.
Modesty precludes a discussion of the result
of following that advice. Suffice to say, I
can defend myself fairly well with rapier or
broadsword, I can tell a Corot from a Raphael
without the aid of artificial devices,
and I have made my way through France
without being arrested or going hungry.</p>

<p>Writers who give advice to the ambitious
usually cite experiences from their own book
of life, but if any young man were to follow
in my footsteps, he’d take a rather devious
path to the stage and he’d have to travel
<i>some</i>.</p>

<p>My parents were far from convinced that
I was cut out for the stage, so I was sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the Colorado School of Mines to become a
mining engineer. But there didn’t seem to
be any room in my head for calculus, trigonometry
and such things. I could never
master higher mathematics; therefore I could
never be a mining engineer, so I quit.</p>

<p>Now I’m not desirous of inflicting a recital
of my deficiencies on a magnanimous
public; just trying to show that one may fail
in many things before finding one’s niche in
life. Certainly I failed in many ventures,
even in my first attack on the American
stage. The first onslaught didn’t even make
a dent on that historic institution.</p>

<p>Important results have often hinged on
trivial things. Tiny causes have had <i>titanic
effects</i>. If a certain actor hadn’t been sent
to jail in Minnesota a dozen and a half years
ago, I wouldn’t now be writing this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
If you are familiar with baseball&mdash;and the
chances are nine in ten that you are&mdash;you
know the meaning of the expression, “the
breaks of the game.” Given two baseball
teams of equal strength, victory will invariably
perch on the banner of the side which
“gets the breaks.”</p>

<p>It’s much the same on the stage or in business.
Many a good player has been sedulously
avoided by whatever fate it is that
deals out fame, because the “breaks” have
been against him. Conversely, many a
mediocre&mdash;or even worse player, has tasted
all the fruits of victory because he “got the
breaks,” as they say on the diamond. But
don’t think I’m going to classify myself, because
I’m not. Give it any name you like&mdash;<i>even
modesty</i>.</p>

<p>Just where I would have wound up had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
it not been for a strange quirk of fate, of
course no one can tell, but it was the misfortune
of a fellow player that gave me the big
chance I was looking for. Perhaps it was an
indiscretion rather than a misfortune. But
whatever it was, the victim of the circumstance
found himself in jail on the day we
were scheduled to treat the natives of Duluth,
Minn., to a rendition of “Hamlet.”</p>

<p>Now I’m not going to tell you how the
star couldn’t show up and I stepped into the
breach and soliloquoyed all over the stage to
the thunderous applause of the Northmen;
that would be too conventional. Strangely
enough I hadn’t set my sights that high.
But I <i>did</i> want to play Laertes and my colleague
having run afoul of some offense
which was the subject of a chapter of the
Minnesota Penal Code, I played it that
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Well, to make a long story short, I played
the part so well (?) that it only took about
ten years more to become a star on Broadway,
the ultimate goal of all who choose the
way of the footlights. Seriously, however,
that was my chance and I took full advantage
of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest pleasure I get out of
my work for the screen is contained in the
daily mail bag. Letters come from everywhere,
not only this country, but from such
far-off places as Australia. By the way, I
believe they are more enthusiastic over the
screen in the Antipodes than they are in this
country, proportionately speaking.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent questions I am
asked to answer is that relating to success in
athletics.</p>

<p>It may sound strange to some of those who
have been following my work on the screen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
but I was a failure as an athlete. In college
at the Colorado School of Mines I did not
excel in any particular branch of sports. I
went in for nearly everything, but the student
body never wrote or sang any songs
about me. I never came up in the ninth with
the score three to nothing against us, with
three men on base, and put the ball over the
fence. I never even ran the length of the
field with the pigskin and scored the winning
touchdown with only fifteen seconds of play
left.</p>

<p>When I went to Harvard later I still was
active in athletics, but while just about able
to get by in most of the games, I never got
<i>the spotlight</i> in any specific instances. It
might have been different had I remained,
but the call of the footlights was too insistent.</p>

<p>There is one rule which every athlete must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
follow to be successful. <i>Be clean in mind
and body.</i> For a starter, I know of no better
advice.</p>

<p>I am not much given to preaching, but if
I ever took it up as a vocation, I would
preach cleanliness first and most.</p>

<p>The boy who wishes to get to the front in
athletics must adopt a program of mental
and bodily cleanliness.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest foe to athletic success,
among young college men is <i>strong
drink</i>. Personally I have never tasted liquor
of any sort.</p>

<p>It was my mother’s influence that was responsible
for that, as I promised her when
I was eight years old that I would never
drink. I might state, parenthetically and
without violating a confidence, that my family
tree had several decorations consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
ambitious men who had sought valiantly, if
futilely, to decrease the visible supply of liquor.
I do not wish to take a great amount
of credit for my abstention. Really, more
credit is due to a person who has fallen under
its influence and fought his way out; but I
know that the keeping of my promise to my
mother has had a powerful effect on my life
and my career.</p>

<span class="subhead">THINGS THAT MONEY WON’T BUY</span></h2>

<p>Everything depends on something else.
There is no such thing as absolute independence,
and those who think differently are
simply asleep at the switch. Of all things
sought for in this world happiness stands
first, and to be sure of this estatic state of being
the common mistake is made in selecting
the path supposed to lead most directly
thereto.</p>

<p>Wealth&mdash;choice No. 1. <i>The common error</i>
of the human family.</p>

<p>Wealth is the great destroyer of happiness,
for it breeds <i>discontent and worry</i>.
In the first place comes the worry of accumulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
wealth and once possessed of it comes
the worry of hanging on to it. It is but a
step from worry to discontent.</p>

<p>But take away the doubt, for the sake of
argument, and analyze wealth from the
standpoint of possession. Now that we have
wealth let’s go ahead and enjoy it. Let us
make of our lives an elysian dream. All
right, here goes.</p>

<p>But first, just what is an <i>elysian dream</i>?
Answer&mdash;an elysian dream is most quickly
defined by the word <i>naught</i>. It is a figure
of speech and only useful in poetic flights&mdash;no
transfers issued. The iridescent dream
is the nearest high-sounding vagary that can
be bought for cash and that has a rainbow
finish. It soon fades and is lost from view.</p>

<div id="ip_128" class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;"><img src="images/p128.jpg" width="398" height="492" alt="" /><div class="caption">Alone with the Grand Canyon</div></div>

<p>So we come quickly back to the proposition
that wealth, while useful to the stomach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and the back, has no purchasing power with
the soul. Happiness is a <i>soul quality</i>&mdash;how
to reach it is a quandary.</p>

<p>Of things earthly we only require a certain
amount; an overplus takes away zest.
The sport of the hunt is no more, when the
quarry is tied up by the heels. Anticipations
are happier far than realizations.
When we aspired we looked forward, and
up. When we indulged to the full our eyes
fell to the ground.</p>

<p>“<i>The fun of gettin’ money is the gettin’
of it, son.</i>” This line is the wind-up of a
wild Western solo one of the boys in camp
used to sing with banjo accompaniment.
That is all I remember of the song. It struck
me as funny and also as being gospel truth.
After having satiated one’s utmost desires,
every luxury seems trivial and vain. Anticipation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
which is a species of joy, no longer
dwells in the heart. Thereafter we hunger
for the unattainable&mdash;<i>contentment</i>. Very
seldom do we change our ways when we have
waxed fat and soft&mdash;and money won’t buy
everything. Note the “if” in old Aunt Dinah’s
Camp Meeting <span class="locked">ditty:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“If Heaven was a place that money could buy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich would live and the po’r would die&mdash;&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And there we are, blockaded with a measley
“if.” There are things that money won’t
buy&mdash;for instance, a <i>good night’s sleep</i>. Our
“open sesame” to the higher level is via the
<i>Self-Denial line</i>. Money won’t buy a ticket&mdash;only
the good and faithful servant may
pass through the turnstile.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BOY ACROSS THE SEA</span></h2>

<p>Paraphrasing a well-known song to fit a
new emergency one of my good friends, on
learning the title of my new book, sends the
following lines which he hopes may find a
place in <i>Making Life Worth While</i>. And
so they shall, with many, many thanks to the
contributor.</p>

<span class="i0">Hoping&mdash;longing&mdash;calling for him.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There is a wonderful pathos in this lyric.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Al Jolson, in a serious moment, could put
enough soul stirring melody in the last line
to bring an audience to its feet. And
wouldn’t “Rodey” make a Billy Sunday
meeting fairly ring with it?</p>

<p>There is more than sentiment in the verse
quoted&mdash;there is <i>duty</i>, <i>loyalty</i>, <i>fidelity</i>. Our
boys have a right to expect that nothing untoward
shall be allowed to disturb their dear
ones while they are absent, and that whatever
the misfortune to themselves over there,
the welcome home will be whole-hearted and
genuine.</p>

<p>If ever there was need of cheerful sympathy,
the genuine article, it should come
forth now for distribution among the homes
from which husband, son, or brother has gone
forward in defense of civilization. One need
not fear to show an interest, which is heartfelt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
to any wife, mother, father, or other
relatives of an American soldier. It is a
relief to them to share their hopes and fears
with friendly neighbors. They are brave as
they never were before. They are <i>fortified</i>
by the spirit of the manly fellow who went
forth to war through the very gate you lean
upon as they tell what they know.</p>

<p>One very dear mother, much too young in
appearance to suggest the idea of having sent
a son to the front, told me as she smiled
through tears that he had <i>brought down
two</i> in a single action, but unfortunately was
forced to land on enemy soil and was made
a prisoner.</p>

<p>“I hope they don’t starve him,” said she
sweetly, “nor treat him cruelly. He is so
gentle and kindly himself. I believe they
will be good to him.”</p>

<p>“Of course they will,” said I, joining my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
hope with her own and wishing with all my
might that I could really share in her belief.
Then her wistful look changed into one of
confident expectancy. I had added to her
<i>store of hopefulness</i> and left her laughing
heartily at my prophecy that her boy would
probably “<i>kidnap his guard some night and
ride him back to camp</i>.”</p>

<p>No doubt about her keeping the home fires
burning, nor of the strong heart within her&mdash;“<i>hoping,
longing, calling for him</i>.”</p>

<span class="subhead">SUPERIOR&mdash;SUPERIORITY&mdash;SUPER</span></h2>

<p>This word <i>super</i> is getting its name in the
papers every day in the week. The <i>super-human</i>
effort required to keep things moving
along toward the <i>final triumph</i> has needed
just such expressive terms. It is a last word
in inspiration&mdash;big, effective&mdash;<i>over and beyond</i>&mdash;and
it fits the job we’re engaged in
exactly from super-dreadnaught to super-abundance
of will-power, mainstrength, and
<i>get there</i>.</p>

<p>When our boys went over and lined up
alongside their war-worn Allies, the whole
situation changed. The <i>pep</i> and <i>snap</i> they
brought along completely banished the waning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
spirit which, nevertheless, still held in
check a relentless and overpowering foe. No
tonic is there so productive of renewed energy
as the <i>entrance of a friend</i> who quietly
takes his place by one’s side.</p>

<p>To merely say that the boys in khaki have
won the hearts of their comrades over there is
inadequate. They have <i>sealed a compact</i>
that is destined to shape the orderly course of
the whole world for a century to come.
Their induction was not of the “make way
for the conquering heroes” kind. Nothing
like that&mdash;more of the fashion of <i>those who
are tardy</i> and quietly take the places reserved
for them.</p>

<p>Once in the ranks, comradeship was a matter
of course. No one could hold out against
American good nature. No chance that
these new soldiers ranging themselves alongside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of veterans would resort to grandstand
play. There would be no chasing after the
medal. If it came, well and good, but the
job in hand would be the first consideration&mdash;and
in that respect the men of the Allied
armies and navies <i>are well met</i>.</p>

<p>To my way of thinking the every-day athletic
sports of the English-speaking races
make for <i>a gallant hardihood</i>. No braver
are they, but hardier perhaps, and more agile
than their Latin brother-in-arms because
of their all-of-the-year-round season of out-of-door
recreation. Baseball, golf, hockey,
polo, motor-boating, rowing, skiing, football,
riding to hounds and what not, even
down to the game of marbles, which, after
all, is out-of-door exercise for the small
boy.</p>

<p>Take football, for instance. If medals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
honor were given out for <i>daring physical action
and bravery</i> that occurs on the “grid-irons”
of America, England, Canada and
Australia each year even the Kaiser’s <i>Iron
Cross factory</i> would be unable to supply the
demand. In other words, out-of-door sports
make for <i>alertness</i> of mind and body. In
this respect they differ from the labor of the
soil which, while hardening and muscle-making,
is inspiriting from lack of competitive
prowess with <i>a goal in sight</i> to work for.</p>

<p>It is fine to read about our boys over there.
They have taken hold of their end of the big
job without splurge or pompous bearing.
They have aroused no jealousies, no heart-burnings
through competitive ambitions&mdash;<i>they
go where sent</i>. Their inborn initiative
spurs them on to deeds that terminate to
victories they least expect. It is not a part
of their dispositions to “grab all” for honors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
They will give rather than take from the
credit of their comrades in arms. The old
charge of <i>American brag</i> will fall of its own
weight on the battlefields of France. To excel
is an American trait no less and no more
than their brothers in the field of action.
One of the blessings that must surely follow
in the wake of the great slaughter will be the
common understanding that every Allied soldier
<i>did his duty like a man</i>.</p>

<p>Since writing this chapter, I came across
an editorial in the New York <i>Evening Telegram</i>,
which backs up my theory exactly. It
reads as follows:</p>

<p>“American soldiers and sailors have won
the hearts of England and France. ‘I like
their keenness,’ said a pain-racked British
sergeant through his bandages. ‘It’s good
to be fresh and alive to every little happening
for you and your boys who can plunge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
into hades for the first time and keep their
heads. You may be sure they will go a long
way.’”</p>

<p>At Hamel, where the Americans went in
with the Australians, Lucien and ’Arry and
Paul and Tony and Pat and Izzy stood
shoulder to shoulder, one loyally helping the
other. The commander-in-chief of the Anzacs,
Lieutenant-General Sir John Monash,
is a Jew. Hovering over our fighters were
an aviator from Fort Wayne, Ind.; one from
New York and another from Nogales, Ariz.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHEN THE BOYS COME HOME</span></h2>

<p>Mighty powers are at work in the world
today. Mighty changes are taking place
within the depths of our natures. We are
not satisfied with the old order of things that
have trailed along with our <i>opulent years</i>.
The great holocaust of war has sobered our
senses and we find ourselves taking stock of
the past with particular reference to the future&mdash;the
near future we hope.</p>

<p>We are thinking of the day when the boys
will <i>come back home</i> and we have it in mind
to tidy up considerably by the time they begin
to arrive. We believe they will approve
of our work, and unless they do we may as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
well look the situation squarely in the face&mdash;they’ll
do some cleaning up on their own account.
<i>They’ll finish the job.</i></p>

<p>The order of the day is <i>change</i>. There
are old, worn-out labels that must give place
to new ones, particularly one which has outlived
its usefulness, entitled&mdash;<i>the inherent
rights of man</i>. It needs revising. Its by-laws
must be revamped, recast along modern
lines in order that <i>liberty</i> shall not be mistaken
for <i>license</i> nor any man claim immunity
on the assumption that because this is a
free country <i>he may do as he may please</i>.</p>

<p>When the boys come home they are going
to ask for an accounting. They will want to
take more than just a peep at our stewardship.
Where are the <i>loafers</i> hanging out?
They’ll ask us that. And they’ll ask about
the dives and dens and <i>thief-making sports</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
that boldly flaunted themselves in the days
before <i>the great change</i>.</p>

<p>A lot of the boys won’t come home.
They’ll be asleep, over there, but the big majority
will return and they will be men of
brawn&mdash;<i>resolute and brave</i>. They will begin
at once to ask questions that will make
some of us wince, and they are going to insist
upon truthful answers. “<i>What about the
profiteers?</i>” They’re going to insist on
knowing all about these fellows. They will
seek them out and compel them to disgorge
their ill-gotten gains&mdash;profits taken from the
families of these men who crossed the seas to
rid the world of <i>just such a piratical crew</i>.</p>

<p>And what about <i>booze</i>&mdash;have we given
that traffic the final punch? If it wasn’t
good for soldiers to <i>fight on</i> how could it be
useful in <i>civil life</i>? These are questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
we’ve got to answer when the boys come
home and it looks as though we were going
to be able to give a good account of ourselves&mdash;<i>thanks
to the government</i>.</p>

<p>Things are changing&mdash;many things have
already changed. The big crucial tests upon
our national conscience are coming to a head.
Our government is <i>far-seeing</i> and alert.
Abuses still exist, but the eyes of able men
are upon them. A government that is capable
of sending millions of men under prime
conditions to foreign lands in behalf of our
<i>most precious rights</i> need not be expected
to fall down on the task of cleaning things
up at home while they are away. The whole
world is to be made safe and clean, <i>including
the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.</i></p>

<span class="subhead">REGENERATION</span></h2>

<p>When the great war broke upon an unsuspecting
brotherhood of fellow humans,
we were, as a nation, from prosperity and
self-indulgence, perilously near the brink of
disaster. It is only in the light of events and
a backward glance toward the precipice
which had yawned for us that we may now
indulge in a certain sort of solemn consolation.
At least, we have been saved from a
worse fate, one that has bells on its toes&mdash;our
<i>national intellect</i> was on the wane; likewise
our <i>national conscience</i>. But we were not
alone&mdash;all nations were afflicted, ours no
more than the rest, but we were the younger
and more opulent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
<i>Regeneration or degeneracy?</i> That was
the uppermost question in the public mind
when the king of Berlin turned loose his hosts
of degeneracy, thereby bringing back to its
sober senses the brain power of civilized mankind.
And with it came the brawn.</p>

<p>Now when <i>brain and brawn</i> hook up together
the danger of getting stuck in the
mire is well nigh impossible. Men who had
gone sordid while amassing great fortunes
and looked on passively while their families
cut the swath to which wealth and position
seemed to entitle them, jumped to their feet
with a <i>new light</i> in their eyes, while men just
entering upon the threshold of success stood
in awe of consequences beyond their control.
But the main thing to happen was that the
world turned its face toward the great intruder
and, thereby, its heels toward the fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
abyss into which millions would have fallen
<i>from sheer crowding from behind</i>.</p>

<p>We had been following the modern tendency
and had gone the limit in quest of that
will-o’-the-wisp called <i>pleasure</i>&mdash;which we
never quite found. We nearly did, or
thought we surely would, but in our hot pursuit
we heard the blast of a <i>war trumpet</i>
and we stopped in our tracks!</p>

<p>The weakest link in the chain of <i>self-gratification</i>
had broken&mdash;the War Lord and his
hosts had gone stark mad! Now was the
time for the cohorts of insanity to wreak vengeance
upon the joy-seeking, peace-loving
people of the world. We who were on the
brink of another kind of pitfall&mdash;<i>too much
opulence</i>&mdash;paused in awe and horror to
gaze upon the oncoming hords. And right
here began <i>the regeneration of mankind</i>.</p>

<p>No one, taking the larger view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
world’s greatest catastrophe since the flood,
will hesitate to believe that, even unto its
most horrible detail, it represents the working
out of <i>some great plan</i>. The world was
far better off after the flood, for when the
waters receded it was found that the valleys
had been enriched by the washings from the
mountain-sides and the hills. A new virginity
had entered into the soil, the future
value of which, to mankind, being wholly
beyond computation.</p>

<p>And so in the final reckoning this tremendous
letting of blood will have long since
shed light upon its true significance. To-day
we estimate it upon the basis of its horrors,
its seeming uselessness, <i>the blight of its trail</i>
across our own dooryards. But we’ve all
heard of the <i>fungus growth</i> which blights the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
progress of plants and trees; and <i>parasites</i>
which destroy the grains of the field, bringing
famine upon the population. In the
present case the tentacles of the great Octopus
of Degeneracy took such strangling hold
upon the body politic that half a world seems
doomed to die that the other half may live
in aid of the great plan of the universe. In
the meantime, <i>no life is worth while</i> that
takes no part in the titanic struggle, which
must go on and on until, in the words of our
leader, “<i>the world is made safe for democracy</i>.”</p>
